# Intro to Machine Learning Assignments
---
This is a public archive of some of the work I've done within this class. Each week is split into its own directory for organization and allows the progression to be overseen.

As an introductory course, there isn't a lot of bulk work being done; instead, the focus is on getting introduced to concepts and the language used to work with such concepts. This is why there is a lot of writing within the notebooks over the python language and why such things being done with the python language are very textbook. In either case, this is usually how I code anyways as I believe that good writing is good thinking.

## Missing Weeks
Any missing weeks are due that week being purely writing focused or something done in Tableau.
